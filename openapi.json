For example, if a field is enabled for projects A, B, and C then the search could be limited to projects B and C. However, if the search is limited to projects B and D, nothing is returned.\n *  not return Connect app users and groups.\n *  return groups that have a case-insensitive match with the query.\n\nThe primary use case for this resource is to populate a picker field suggestion list with users or groups. To this end, the returned object includes an `html` field for each list. This field highlights the matched query term in the item name with the HTML strong tag. Also, each list is wrapped in a response object that contains a header for use in a picker, specifically *Showing X of Y matching groups*.\n\nThis operation can be accessed anonymously.\n\n**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Browse users and groups* [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg).",

In this case, the type is `\"type\": \"group\"`, and the parameter is the group name, `\"parameter\": \"Teams in space administrators\"` and the value is group ID, `\"value\": \"ca85fac0-d974-40ca-a615-7af99c48d24f\"`.\n\nThe `holder` object is defined by the following properties:\n\n *  `type` Identifies the user or group (see the list of types below).\n *  `parameter` As a group's name can change, use of `value` is recommended. The value of this property depends on the `type`. For example, if the `type` is a group, then you need to specify the group name.\n *  `value` The value of this property depends on the `type`. If the `type` is a group, then you need to specify the group ID. For other `type` it has the same value as `parameter`\n\nThe following `types` are available. The expected values for `parameter` and `value` are given in parentheses (some types may not have a `parameter` or `value`):\n\n *  `anyone` Grant for anonymous users.\n *  `applicationRole` Grant for users with access to the specified application (application name, application name). See [Update product access settings](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/3YxjL) for more information.\n *  `assignee` Grant for the user currently assigned to an issue.\n *  `group` Grant for the specified group (`parameter` : group name, `value` : group ID).\n *  `groupCustomField` Grant for a user in the group selected in the specified custom field (`parameter` : custom field ID, `value` : custom field ID).\n *  `projectLead` Grant for a project lead.\n *  `projectRole` Grant for the specified project role (`parameter` :project role ID, `value` : project role ID).\n *  `reporter` Grant for the user who reported the issue.\n *  `sd.customer.portal.only` Jira Service Desk only. Grants customers permission to access the customer portal but not Jira. See [Customizing Jira Service Desk permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24dKLg) for more information.\n *  `user` Grant for the specified user (`parameter` : user ID - historically this was the userkey but that is deprecated and the account ID should be used, `value` : user ID).\n *  `userCustomField` Grant for a user selected in the specified custom field (`parameter` : custom field ID, `value` : custom field ID).\n\n#### Built-in permissions ####\n\nThe [built-in Jira permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) are listed below. Apps can also define custom permissions. See the [project permission](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/project-permission/) and [global permission](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/global-permission/) module documentation for more information.\n\n**Project permissions**\n\n *  `ADMINISTER_PROJECTS`\n *  `BROWSE_PROJECTS`\n *  `MANAGE_SPRINTS_PERMISSION` (Jira Software only)\n *  `SERVICEDESK_AGENT` (Jira Service Desk only)\n *  `VIEW_DEV_TOOLS` (Jira Software only)\n *  `VIEW_READONLY_WORKFLOW`\n\n**Issue permissions**\n\n *  `ASSIGNABLE_USER`\n *  `ASSIGN_ISSUES`\n *  `CLOSE_ISSUES`\n *  `CREATE_ISSUES`\n *  `DELETE_ISSUES`\n *  `EDIT_ISSUES`\n *  `LINK_ISSUES`\n *  `MODIFY_REPORTER`\n *  `MOVE_ISSUES`\n *  `RESOLVE_ISSUES`\n *  `SCHEDULE_ISSUES`\n *  `SET_ISSUE_SECURITY`\n *  `TRANSITION_ISSUES`\n\n**Voters and watchers permissions**\n\n *  `MANAGE_WATCHERS`\n *  `VIEW_VOTERS_AND_WATCHERS`\n\n**Comments permissions**\n\n *  `ADD_COMMENTS`\n *  `DELETE_ALL_COMMENTS`\n *  `DELETE_OWN_COMMENTS`\n *  `EDIT_ALL_COMMENTS`\n *  `EDIT_OWN_COMMENTS`\n\n**Attachments permissions**\n\n *  `CREATE_ATTACHMENTS`\n *  `DELETE_ALL_ATTACHMENTS`\n *  `DELETE_OWN_ATTACHMENTS`\n\n**Time tracking permissions**\n\n *  `DELETE_ALL_WORKLOGS`\n *  `DELETE_OWN_WORKLOGS`\n *  `EDIT_ALL_WORKLOGS`\n *  `EDIT_OWN_WORKLOGS`\n *  `WORK_ON_ISSUES`\n\n**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** Permission to access Jira.",

See [Add scopes to call an Atlassian REST API](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/add-scopes-to-call-an-atlassian-rest-api/) for more details.\n\nThe URIs for Forge app REST API calls have this structure:\n\n`/rest/api/3/<resource-name>`\n\nFor example, `/rest/api/3/issue/DEMO-1`\n\n### Connect apps\n\nFor Connect apps, authentication (JWT-based) is built into the Connect libraries. Authorization is implemented using either \nscopes (shown as _App scope required_ for operations on this page) or user impersonation. See \n[Security for Connect apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/security-for-connect-apps/) \nfor details.\n\nThe URIs for Connect app REST API calls have this structure:\n\n`https://<site-url>/rest/api/3/<resource-name>`\n\nFor example, `https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/DEMO-1`\n\n### Other integrations\n\nFor integrations that are not Forge or Connect apps, use OAuth 2.0 authorization code grants (3LO) for security \n(3LO scopes are shown as for operations _OAuth scopes required_). See \n[OAuth 2.0 (3LO) apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/oauth-2-3lo-apps/) \nfor details.\n\nThe URIs for OAuth 2.0 (3LO) app REST API calls have this structure:\n\n`https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/<cloudId>/rest/api/3/<resource-name>`\n\nFor example, `https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/35273b54-3f06-40d2-880f-dd28cf8daafa/rest/api/3/issue/DEMO-1`\n\n### Ad-hoc API calls\n\nFor personal scripts, bots, and ad-hoc execution of the REST APIs use basic authentication.

Note that for Connect apps, the app user must have the required permissions for the operation and the app must \nhave scopes that permit the operation.\n\nA permission can be granted to a group, project role, or issue role that the user is a member of, or granted directly to a user. \nSee [Permissions overview](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/FQiiLQ) for details. The most common permissions are:\n\n- **Administer the Cloud site**: Users in the _site-admins_ group have this \npermission. See [Manage groups](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24xjL) for details.\n- **Administer Jira**: Granted by the _Jira Administrators_ global permission. There is a default group for this permission. \nSee [Manage groups](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24xjL) and [Managing global permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg) for details.\n- **Administer a project in Jira**: Granted by the _Administer projects_ project permission for a project. This can be \ngranted to a user, a group, a project role, and more. \nSee [Managing project permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for details.\n- **Access a project in Jira**: Granted by the _Browse projects_ project permission for a project. This can be \ngranted to a user, a group, a project role, and more. \nSee [Managing project permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for details.\n- **Access Jira**: Granted by the _Jira Users_ global permission. Users in the default product access group (for example, \n_jira-software-users-acmesite_) have this permission. \nSee [Manage groups](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24xjL) and \n[Managing global permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg) for details.\n\n### Anonymous access\n\nSome operations provide support for anonymous access. However, anonymous access is only available if \nthe Jira permission needed to access the object or records returned by the operation is granted to \nthe _Public_ group. See [Allowing anonymous access to your project](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/GDxxLg) \nfor details.\n\nIf an operation is called anonymously and anonymous access is not available, the operation will return \nan error.

        "anchor": "expansion",
        "body": "### Expansion\n\nThe Jira REST API uses resource expansion, which means that some parts of a resource are not returned unless specified \nin the request. This simplifies responses and minimizes network traffic.\n\nTo expand part of a resource in a request, use the expand query parameter and specify the object(s) to be expanded. \nIf you need to expand nested objects, use the `.` dot notation. If you need to expand multiple objects, use a \ncomma-separated list. \n\nFor example, the following request expands the `names` and `renderedFields` properties for the _JRACLOUD-34423_ issue:\n\n`GET issue/JRACLOUD-34423?expand=names,renderedFields`\n\nTo discover which object can be expanded, refer to the `expand` property in the object. \nIn the JSON example below, the resource declares `widgets` as expandable.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"expand\": \"widgets\", \n  \"self\": \"https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/resource/KEY-1\", \n  \"widgets\": {\n    \"widgets\": [],\n    \"size\": 5\n   }\n}\n```\n\n### Pagination\n\nThe Jira REST API uses pagination to improve performance. Pagination is enforced for operations that could return a large \ncollection of items. When you make a request to a paginated resource, the response wraps the returned array of values in \na JSON object with paging metadata. For example:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"startAt\" : 0,\n    \"maxResults\" : 10,\n    \"total\": 200,\n    \"isLast\": false,\n    \"values\": [\n        { /* result 0 */ },\n        { /* result 1 */ },\n        { /* result 2 */ }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n*   `startAt` is the index of the first item returned in the page.\n*   `maxResults` is the maximum number of items that a page can return. Each operation can have a different limit for\n    the number of items returned, and these limits may change without notice. To find the maximum number of items \n    that an operation could return, set `maxResults` to a large number—for example, over 1000—and if the returned value of `maxResults` is less than the requested value, the returned value is the maximum.\n*    `total` is the total number of items contained in all pages. This number **_may change_** as the client \nrequests the subsequent pages, therefore the client should always assume that the requested page can be empty. Note \nthat this property is not returned for all operations.\n*   `isLast` indicates whether the page returned is the last one. Note that this property is not returned for all operations.\n\n### Ordering\n\nSome operations support ordering the elements of a response by a field. Check the documentation for the operation to \nconfirm whether ordering of a response is supported and which fields can be used. Responses are listed in ascending order \nby default. You can change the order using the `orderby` query parameter with a `-` or `+` symbol. For example:\n\n*   `?orderBy=name` to order by `name` field ascending.\n*   `?orderBy=+name` to order by `name` field ascending.\n*   `?orderBy=-name` to order by `name` field descending.\n\n\n"
